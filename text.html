      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Sheffield,
        passionate about motorsport, vehicle performance, and applied engineering. 
        I am actively seeking a 2026/27 industrial placement to apply my technical skills, 
        hands-on project experience, and problem-solving mindset in a high-performance engineering environment.

      <h2>Projects & Experience</h2>

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Bike Gearbox Design – Second Year</h3>
        <p>Developed a gearbox for an Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle (EAPC), transmitting power from an electric motor to the rear wheel. Achieved a top 10% performance result.</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>
        <div class="extra-details">
          <p>
            My role focused on designing a reduction system and adapting motor-control code. 
            A prototype failure during testing required me to lead a rapid redesign, implementing 
            robust joints and revising the code. The final design maximised efficiency and durability, 
            achieving strong test results. This project developed my skills in CAD, FEA simulation, 
            prototyping, problem-solving under pressure, and teamwork.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Water Bottle Rocket Launcher – First Year</h3>
        <p>Designed and built a compressed-air powered launcher, integrating safety mechanisms and trajectory modelling.</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>
        <div class="extra-details">
          <p>
            Combined MATLAB simulations with physical testing to optimise pressure, water volume, 
            and launch angle. Iterative improvements led to increased accuracy and stability. 
            On test day, all rockets landed within 10m of the target, earning full marks. 
            Strengthened my analytical approach, modelling skills, and attention to detail.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Engineering You’re Hired – University Challenge</h3>
        <p>Worked in a multidisciplinary team to design an implant-based biosensor to reduce infection rates in hip and knee replacements.</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>
        <div class="extra-details">
          <p>
            Tasked with creating a sustainable, biocompatible solution that minimises infection risks. 
            My role was researching antimicrobial coatings and developing an inclusivity policy to ensure 
            our solution was patient-centred. The final design projected up to a 30–50% reduction in 
            revision surgeries. Gained experience in collaboration, research, and innovation in healthcare engineering.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Global Engineering Challenge</h3>
        <p>Collaborated with engineers from multiple disciplines to design transport infrastructure for a rural Cambodian village. Awarded the Dr. Trish Murray Professional Behaviours Team Award.</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>
        <div class="extra-details">
          <p>
            Our team identified flooding resilience as the primary challenge and proposed 
            a raised laterite road with culverts and a compacted gravel surface. 
            I contributed to analysis, decision matrices, and cost evaluations. 
            This project developed my teamwork, problem-solving, and cross-cultural engineering awareness.

      <article class="project">
        <h3>Astley Hire – Summer Internship</h3>
        <p>Worked as an assistant maintenance engineer, carrying out inspections and repairs on industrial equipment.</p>
        <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>
        <div class="extra-details">
          <p>
            Performed PDIs on scissor lifts and industrial washers, troubleshooting electrical and 
            mechanical faults. Gained hands-on experience in wiring, component testing, 
            and maintenance. Completed multiple training courses including IPAF, PASMA, and Harness Inspection.
