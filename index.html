      <h3>Bike Gearbox Design</h3>
      <p>Designed and tested a gearbox for an EAPC, achieving top 10% in final test performance.</p>

          This second-year group project focused on transmitting power from an electric motor to the rear wheel while meeting UK regulations. 
          We compared belt drives, planetary sets, and two-stage spur gear concepts, selecting the latter for its balance of efficiency and manufacturability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led gear module selection, CAD modelling, and FEA validation to check load transfer and durability. 
          Our first prototype, manufactured in laser-cut acrylic, failed when a gear sheared from the shaft due to adhesive joints. 
          This was a turning point — we redesigned the assembly with bolted and clamped connections, improving reliability.
        </p>
        <p>
          In final testing, our design ranked in the top 10% for material efficiency and assembly time, and achieved competitive performance in distance trials. 
          This project sharpened my skills in CAD, simulation, prototyping, and rapid design iteration under tight deadlines.

      <h3>Water Bottle Rocket Launcher</h3>
      <p>Built and modelled a compressed-air rocket system, combining MATLAB simulations with experimental testing.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          Working in a first-year team, we designed a compressed-air water rocket launcher with a safe, adjustable release mechanism. 
          I contributed to CAD modelling of the launcher frame and developed MATLAB code to predict trajectory based on input pressure, water volume, and drag.
        </p>
        <p>
          We initially faced stability issues — rockets veered unpredictably due to centre-of-pressure misalignment. 
          To solve this, we added fins, a nose cone, and a slanted launch rail for angle control. 
          This iterative approach improved both safety and accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          On test day, our simulation predicted the required pressure for a 70 m target, and all three launches landed within 10 m of the goal. 
          The project gave me valuable experience in integrating modelling with experimental data, and taught me the importance of validation when bridging theory and practice.

      <h3>Reaching Aid Project</h3>
      <p>Designed and prototyped an assistive reaching device to improve accessibility and ergonomics.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          This project challenged us to design a reaching aid for individuals with limited mobility. 
          I worked on developing lightweight, ergonomic mechanisms that balanced strength and usability while keeping manufacturing cost-effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through CAD modelling, rapid prototyping, and physical testing, we evaluated grip strength, stability, and user comfort. 
          My focus was on designing a reliable gripping mechanism using a linkage system that could be manufactured using 3D printing and simple components.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final design was able to lift small household objects securely and comfortably. 
          This project highlighted the importance of inclusive design and gave me first-hand experience in user-centred engineering.

      <h3>Engineering You’re Hired</h3>
      <p>Worked in a multidisciplinary team to design infection-preventing smart implants for hip and knee replacements.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          In this week-long challenge, I collaborated with engineers from different disciplines to design smart implants capable of reducing infection rates in hip and knee replacements. 
          We researched antimicrobial coatings, biosensors, and additive manufacturing techniques to enhance long-term patient outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role was to investigate antimicrobial strategies and draft an inclusivity framework to ensure patient accessibility. 
          I also contributed to concept evaluation and the development of decision matrices to assess feasibility, cost, and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our final design featured a biosensor-enabled implant with an antimicrobial coating, projected to reduce revision surgeries by up to 50%. 
          We presented our findings through both a technical report and a pitch to industry experts, strengthening my skills in technical communication and interdisciplinary teamwork.

      <h3>Global Engineering Challenge Week</h3>
      <p>Collaborated with an international team to create sustainable engineering solutions for real-world problems.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          During this intensive week, I worked with students from across engineering disciplines to address global sustainability challenges. 
          Our team focused on improving water access and energy efficiency in developing regions using low-cost, locally sourced materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I contributed to the system modelling and helped create prototype concepts that integrated renewable energy and efficient resource use. 
          We also produced an impact assessment to evaluate feasibility and community benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience deepened my awareness of the social responsibility of engineers, strengthened my teamwork and leadership in multicultural groups, and reinforced the importance of sustainable, practical solutions.
