  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Sheffield, passionate about motorsport, vehicle performance, and applied engineering. 
    My projects span gearbox design, aerodynamic validation and ergonomic design, all of which have strengthened my CAD, simulation, and problem-solving skills. 
    I’m seeking a 2026/27 placement where I can apply these experiences, contribute to real engineering challenges, and continue learning in a fast-paced engineering environment.

      <p>Designed and tested a gearbox for an EAPC, achieving top 10% in final test performance.</p>

        <p>
          This second-year group project focused on transmitting power from an electric motor to the rear wheel while meeting UK regulations. 
          We compared belt drives, planetary sets, and two-stage spur gear concepts, selecting the latter for its balance of efficiency and manufacturability.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led gear FEA validation of the gear buckling ensuring stability and safety and the code implemted for motor control 
          Within our first test, an oversight in the code resulted in a catastrophic failure. I had to take a proactive and positive approach to reverify the code,
          spot the error and modify in time for the final test.
        </p>
        <p>
          In final testing, our design ranked in the top 10% for material efficiency and assembly time, and achieved competitive performance in distance trials. 
          This project sharpened my skills in CAD, simulation, prototyping, and rapid design iteration under tight deadlines.

      <h3>Water Bottle Rocket Launcher</h3>
      <p>Built and modelled a compressed-air rocket system, combining MATLAB simulations with experimental testing.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          Working in a first-year team, we designed a compressed-air water rocket launcher with a safe, adjustable release mechanism. 
          I contributed to CAD modelling of the launcher frame and developed MATLAB code to predict trajectory based on input pressure, water volume, and drag.
        </p>
        <p>
          We initially faced stability issues — rockets veered unpredictably due to centre-of-pressure misalignment. 
          To solve this, we added fins, a nose cone, and a slanted launch rail for angle control. 
          This iterative approach improved both safety and accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          On test day, our simulation predicted the required pressure for a 70 m target, and all three launches landed within 10 m of the goal. 
          The project gave me valuable experience in integrating modelling with experimental data, and taught me the importance of validation when bridging theory and practice.

      <h3>Engineering You’re Hired</h3>
      <p>Worked in a multidisciplinary team to design infection-preventing smart implants for hip and knee replacements.</p>
      <button class="toggle-btn">Tell me more ▼</button>
      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          In this week-long challenge, I collaborated with engineers from different disciplines to design smart implants capable of reducing infection rates in hip and knee replacements. 
          We researched antimicrobial coatings, biosensors, and additive manufacturing techniques to enhance long-term patient outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role was to investigate antimicrobial strategies and draft an inclusivity framework to ensure patient accessibility. 
          I also contributed to concept evaluation and the development of decision matrices to assess feasibility, cost, and sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our final design featured a biosensor-enabled implant with an antimicrobial coating, projected to reduce revision surgeries by up to 50%. 
          We presented our findings through both a technical report and a pitch to industry experts, strengthening my skills in technical communication and interdisciplinary teamwork.

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>
          This individual project involved designing a simple, low-cost reaching aid for elderly users and individuals with reduced mobility. 
          I modelled the mechanism in CAD and used 3D printing and laser-cutting to prototype the design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused on ergonomics, ensuring the handle was comfortable for prolonged use and that the device could lift lightweight household items without strain. 
          The design was validated through CAD motion studies and user feedback sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final prototype was lightweight, durable, and easy to assemble, highlighting my ability to apply mechanical design to practical assistive technologies.
