    <div class="text">
      <h3>Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle Gearbox – Second Year</h3>
      <p>Developed a two-stage gearbox to transmit power from an electric motor to the rear wheel. Achieved a 2:1 result in the project.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>Calculated required gear ratios to meet motor output while complying with UK regulations, explored multiple concepts, and selected a compact two-stage gearbox. Produced detailed CAD models, ran FEA simulations, and prototyped the system. Iterative testing revealed a gear failure, which led to a redesign using clamped and bolted joints. The final system was robust and functional, enhancing my skills in CAD, simulation, design iteration, and prototyping under real-world constraints.</p>

    <img src="Launcher_img.jpg" alt="Water Bottle Rocket Launcher Project Image" />
    <div class="text">
      <h3>Water Bottle Rocket Launcher – First Year</h3>
      <p>Designed and built a compressed air-powered water bottle rocket launcher with safety mechanisms, pressure regulation, and trajectory evaluation.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>Manufactured the mechanical launcher using 3D printing, CNC machining, and workshop tools. Used MATLAB to simulate trajectories, iterated launcher design for stability, and refined rockets with fins and nose cones. On test day, all rockets landed within 10 m of the target, earning a first-class result. Developed skills in CAD, MATLAB programming, data analysis, prototyping, and experimental validation.</p>

    <div class="text">
      <h3>Global Engineering Challenge – 2024</h3>
      <p>Designed transport infrastructure for a remote Cambodian village as part of a multi-disciplinary team. Received the Dr. Trish Murray Professional Behaviours Team Award.</p>

      <button class="toggle-btn">More Details ▼</button>

      <div class="extra-details">
        <p>Surveyed the site, analyzed critical areas, and designed durable, cost-effective roads resistant to flooding. Applied a decision matrix to select the optimal solution and verified calculations for suitability. Gained experience in teamwork, stakeholder management, and practical problem-solving in engineering challenges.</p>
